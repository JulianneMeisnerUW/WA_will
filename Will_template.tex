\begin{document}
\maketitle

I, [your name in caps], of [city], [county] County, [state], do hereby declare this to be my Last Will and Testament, that is to say:

\section{Revocation of prior Wills and Codicils}
I hereby revoke all former Wills and Codicils which I have made

\section{Family}
I am [marital status]. My immediate family is now composed of my [relationship], [name], and my [relationship], [name]. All references hereinafter to ``my children'' or the like shall be limited to the children specifically named in this article and any child born to or adopted by me after the date of this Will.

\section{Payment of debts and memorial requests}
\subsection{Payment of debts}
I hereby direct that all my lawful debts and the expenses of my last sickness, memorial service, funeral, cremation, and testamentary expenses be paid by my Personal Representative hereinafter named, as soon after my demise as practicable; provided, however, that this direction shall not authorize any creditor to require payment of any debt or obligation prior to its normal maturity in due course. This directions hall not be construed as giving any creditor a claim against or interest in my estate. My Personal Representative may refuse payment to any creditor who has not timely and properly filed a creditor's claim under applicable laws. 

\subsection{Memorial requests}
It is my wish that my body be donated to the Willed Body Program of the University of Washington. I wish for any of my remains which are returned from the Willed Body Program to be cremated, and for my Personal Representative to decide on a suitable resting place for my ashes. 

\section{Gifts}
I give all of my assets to[relationship], [name], if he survives me. If my [relationship] does not survive me, I give all of my assets to my [relationship], [name], if he survives me. 

\section{Statement regarding custodianships}
I desire that the custodian of any custodianship referred to herein preserve the financial resources thereof to the greatest extent possible so as to maximize the value of the custodial property at the time it is ultimately distributed to the beneficiary thereof. To this end, I encourage the custodian not to expend the financial resources of any such custodianship except to the extent doing so is necessary to protect the health or safety of the beneficiary thereof.

\section{Fiduciaries}
\subsection{Personal representative}
I hereby appoint my [relationship], [name], as my Personal Representative, should he survive me. If [name] is unable or unwilling to serve, then I designate that my [relationship], [name], shall be my Personal Representative. 

\subsection{Custodian}
I hereby appoint my [relationship], [name] as the custodian of any custodianship required to be created by this Will. If [name] is or becomes unable to act or to continue to act as custodian, the alternate or successor custodian shall be my [relationship], [name].

\subsection{Guardian}
If it should be necessary to appoint a guardian of a child of mine, I designate the following person to serve as guardian of the estates and persons of such child, if the child’s other parent cannot so serve: my [relationship], [name].

\section{Duties and powers of fiduciaries}
\subsection{Personal Representative}
My Personal Representative shall have nonintervention powers. I authorize my Personal Representative to act without bond. If bond is nonetheless required, I request the bond be accepted without surety and in the lowest possible amount. My Personal Representative shall have the authority to make all elections involved in the application of state and federal taxes to my estate and the beneficiaries thereof, shall not be required to make any adjustment between principal and income or in the relative interests of the beneficiaries to compensate for the effect of such an election, and shall have no liability to any beneficiary on account of taxes or other charges allocable to a beneficiary’s interest resulting from such an election. My Personal Representative shall be entitled to reasonable compensation payable not less frequently than annually together with current reimbursement for all reasonable expenditures.

\subsection{Custodian}
A custodian of any custodianship required to be created by this Will shall be entitled to reasonable compensation and reimbursement of reasonable expenses as permitted by the Washington uniform transfers to minors act.

\subsection{Guardian}
I authorize any guardian appointed under this Will to act without bond. If bond is nonetheless required, I request the bond be accepted without surety and in the lowest possible amount. A guardian shall have the authority to change the domicile of a child of mine at any time unless to do so would be adverse to the child’s best interests. Any person who has been appointed a guardian of a child of mine shall be entitled to reasonable compensation payable not less frequently than annually together with current reimbursement for all reasonable expenditures.

\subsection{Fiduciary Compensation} A determination of the compensation for each fiduciary appointed in this Will should take into account the fiduciary’s risks and responsibilities and the value of the assets being administered. My Personal Representative and any person who has been appointed a guardian of a child of mine shall be entitled, though not directed, to obtain court approval of any compensation arrangement or payment upon notice to all interested parties as defined in RCW 11.96A.110 and 11.96A.120 and to do so at the reasonable expense of the involved estate.

\section{General provisions}
\subsection{Context} As the context may require, the gender of all words used herein shall include the masculine, feminine, and neuter, and the singular of all words shall include the plural and the plural the singular.
\subsection{Severability} If any provision of this instrument is unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect.
\subsection{Governing Law and References} This instrument shall be governed by Washington law and by applicable federal law. All references made to the statutes or legislative acts of any jurisdiction include any amendments and successor legislation.
\subsection{Headings} The headings in this instrument are included for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of any provision hereof.
\subsection{Survive} The term “survive” when used in reference to a given person, shall mean to continue to live for at least twenty (20) days after the death of that person.
\subsection{Descendant} The term “descendant” when applied to a given person, shall include such person’s children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, etc., and shall include both descendants by blood and descendants by adoption.
\subsection{Per Capita at Each Generation} When an estate or any interest therein passes ``per capita at each generation'' respecting a given person, the same shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are (i) surviving descendants of the person in the generation nearest to the person which contains one or more surviving descendants, and (ii) deceased descendants of the person in the same generation who left surviving descendants, if any. Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation shall be allocated one share. For shares in the latter category, if any, the same process of dividing and distributing shares shall be repeated in like manner at each subsequent generation until all shares have been distributed. No descendant being a grandchild or remoter descendant of the person will take a share if his or her parent is alive and takes a share.
\subsection{Share and Share Alike} When an estate or any interest therein passes to designated beneficiaries ``share and share alike,'' the estate or interest shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving beneficiaries so designated. Each such surviving beneficiary shall be allocated one share, and the anti-lapse provisions of RCW 11.12.110 or any similar or successor statutes shall have no effect.
